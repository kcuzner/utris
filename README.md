# uTris (micro-tris)
By Kevin Cuzner

## Overview

This is a 1KB implementation of the classic falling blocks game using trominos
instead of tetrominos. It is written entirely in C. It can be easily adapted to
use the traditional tetrominos, provided that 140 bytes of extra flash could be
found for the bitmap (or a better bitmap format invented which isn't so
wasteful).

## Schematic

This is probably my least specific schematic I've ever made:
